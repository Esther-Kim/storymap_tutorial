# Story Maps!
Use this repo to make ready to go story maps with either Leaflet or MapboxGL JS mapping libraries.

### What the difference between Leaflet and Mapbox?
* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a robust mapping library to load rasters tiles. It's development has been instrumental in bringing open source to maps and anyone wanting to make a map.
* [MapboxGL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) is the next stage in developing web maps as it uses vector tiles and many awesome features like handling large datasets and styling maps on the client side.

### Wow that's awesome, so how can I have a map like right now?
* One of the cool things about [open source](https://opensource.org/) is that we can distribute our work with others with no license (free). If you got an amazing project you're developing, others can join in and contribute.
* One of the ways we can distribute code and works are with platforms like Github! Which is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration, its like you sharing your Google Doc with others to edit. If someone makes some mistakes on your document and you want to return back to the version 3 days ago, you can. This is similiar. 
* There's more to Github, but in this instance we are gonna use this platform to host our maps.
* So let's make a map that will be live in a matter of minutes.

#### Steps to have github host webmaps
1. In order for you to host maps on github you need an [account](https://github.com/)
2. Log in to your account and come back to this repository (A repository aka repo is used to organize a single project, they can contain folders, files, images, datasets, pretty much anything you need for your project). In fact you are at the repository right now!
3. We need to  `fork` this repository to your account, because right now its being hosted through maptimeLA's account. Creating a `fork` is producing a personal copy of someone else's project in this case maptimeLA's. [Want to know more about forking?](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
4. Fork this repo by clicking on the button labeled fork.
